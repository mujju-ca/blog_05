        The M3 family of chips continues Apple silicon's tremendous pace of
        innovation. M3, M3 Pro, and M3 Max are the first chips for a personal
        computer built using the industry-leading 3-nanometer technology. With
        a faster, more efficient next-generation GPU, these chips deliver the
        biggest leap forward in graphics architecture ever for Apple silicon.
        Featuring a breakthrough technology called Dynamic Caching, the GPU
        allocates the use of local memory in hardware in real time so only the
        exact amount of memory needed is used for each task. This dramatically
        increases GPU utilization and performance for the most demanding pro
        apps and games.
